# MovieApp

This is a movie search app that utilizes the Movie DB (https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to display information about movies based on the users' search.

Assumptions:
1. In the movie cell list view, I have made an assumption that each row of the table view should have variable height based on the length of the movie description as it was my understanding that the app should display the entire movie description in the search results list.  

External Libraries:
1. Realm for persistence.
